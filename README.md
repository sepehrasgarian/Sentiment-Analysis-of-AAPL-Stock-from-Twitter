In the past two decades, the growth of social data on the web has rapidly increased, in this project I used sentiment analysis of AAPL stock on Feb, March, April, and May to see how people react to stock during covid19 and if it is a relationship between comments and price of AAPL. Many factors in the stock market affect the movement of the stock and, the sentiments of comments on Twitter can be used as one of the features to predict the future of the stock.

I used vaderSentiment library for sentiment analysis there is a good tutorial of how it is working in https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/simplifying-social-media-sentiment-analysis-using-vader-in-python-f9e6ec6fc52f 

 My results can be shown in result folder.
